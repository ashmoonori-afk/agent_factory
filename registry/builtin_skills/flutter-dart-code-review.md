# Skill: Flutter/Dart Code Review Best Practices

## When to Use
Library-agnostic Flutter/Dart code review checklist covering widget best practices, state management patterns (BLoC, Riverpod, Provider, GetX, MobX, Signals), Dart idioms, performance, accessibility, security, and clean architecture.

## Policy
Level: ALLOW

## Instructions
## 1. General Project Health

- [ ] Project follows consistent folder structure (feature-first or layer-first)
- [ ] Proper separation of concerns: UI, business logic, data layers
- [ ] No business logic in widgets; widgets are purely presentational
- [ ] `pubspec.yaml` is clean — no unused dependencies, versions pinned appropriately
- [ ] `analysis_options.yaml` includes a strict lint set with strict analyzer settings enabled
- [ ] No `print()` statements in production code — use `dart:developer` `log()` or a logging package
- [ ] Generated files (`.g.dart`, `.freezed.dart`, `.gr.dart`) are up-to-date or in `.gitignore`
- [ ] Platform-specific code isolated behind abstractions

---

## 2. Dart Language Pitfalls

- [ ] **Implicit dynamic**: Missing type annotations leading to `dynamic` — enable `strict-casts`, `strict-inference`, `strict-raw-types`
- [ ] **Null safety misuse**: Excessive `!` (bang operator) instead of proper null checks or Dart 3 pattern matching (`if (value case var v?)`)
- [ ] **Type promotion failures**: Using `this.field` where local variable promotion would work
- [ ] **Catching too broadly**: `catch (e)` without `on` clause; always specify exception types
- [ ] **Catching `Error`**: `Error` subtypes indicate bugs and should not be caught
- [ ] **Unused `async`**: Functions marked `async` that never `await` — unnecessary overhead
- [ ] **`late` overuse**: `late` used where nullable or constructor initialization would be safer; defers errors to runtime
- [ ] **String concatenation in loops**: Use `StringBuffer` instead of `+` for iterative string building
- [ ] **Mutable state in `const` contexts**: Fields in `const` constructor classes should not be mutable
- [ ] **Ignoring `Future` return values**: Use `await` or explicitly call `unawaited()` to signal intent
- [ ] **`var` where `final` works**: Prefer `final` for locals and `const` for compile-time constants
- [ ] **Relative imports**: Use `package:` imports for consistency
- [ ] **Mutable collections exposed**: Public APIs should return unmodifiable views, not raw `List`/`Map`
- [ ] **Missing Dart 3 pattern matching**: Prefer switch expressions and `if-case` over verbose `is` checks and manual casting
- [ ] **Throwaway classes for multiple returns**: Use Dart 3 records `(String, int)` instead of single-use DTOs
- [ ] **`print()` in production code**: Use `dart:developer` `log()` or the project's logging package; `print()` has no log levels and cannot be filtered

## 3. Widget Best Practices

### Widget decomposition:
- [ ] No single widget with a `build()` method exceeding ~80-100 lines
- [ ] Widgets split by encapsulation AND by how they change (rebuild boundaries)
- [ ] Private `_build*()` helper methods that return widgets are extracted to separate widget classes (enables element reuse, const propagation, and framework optimizations)
- [ ] Stateless widgets preferred over Stateful where no mutable local state is needed
- [ ] Extracted widgets are in separate files

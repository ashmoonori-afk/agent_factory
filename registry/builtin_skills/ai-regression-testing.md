# Skill: AI Regression Testing

## When to Use
- AI agent (Claude Code, Cursor, Codex) has modified API routes or backend logic
- A bug was found and fixed — need to prevent re-introduction
- Project has a sandbox/mock mode that can be leveraged for DB-free testing
- Running `/bug-check` or similar review commands after code changes
- Multiple code paths exist (sandbox vs production, feature flags, etc.)

## The Core Problem

When an AI writes code and then reviews its own work, it carries the same assumptions into both steps. This creates a predictable failure pattern:

```
AI writes fix → AI reviews fix → AI says "looks correct" → Bug still exists
```

**Real-world example** (observed in production):

```
Fix 1: Added notification_settings to API response
  → Forgot to add it to the SELECT query
  → AI reviewed and missed it (same blind spot)

Fix 2: Added it to SELECT query
  → TypeScript build error (column not in generated types)
  → AI reviewed Fix 1 but didn't catch the SELECT issue

Fix 3: Changed to SELECT *
  → Fixed production path, forgot sandbox path
  → AI reviewed and missed it AGAIN (4th occurrence)

Fix 4: Test caught it instantly on first run ✅
```

The pattern: **sandbox/production path inconsistency** is the #1 AI-introduced regression.

## Sandbox-Mode API Testing

Most projects with AI-friendly architecture have a sandbox/mock mode. This is the key to fast, DB-free API testing.

### Setup (Vitest + Next.js App Router)

```typescript
// vitest.config.ts
import { defineConfig } from "vitest/config";
import path from "path";

export default defineConfig({
  test: {
    environment: "node",
    globals: true,
    include: ["__tests__/**/*.test.ts"],
    setupFiles: ["__tests__/setup.ts"],
  },
  resolve: {
    alias: {
      "@": path.resolve(__dirname, "."),
    },
  },
});
```

```typescript
// __tests__/setup.ts
// Force sandbox mode — no database needed
process.env.SANDBOX_MODE = "true";
process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL = "";
process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY = "";
```

### Test Helper for Next.js API Routes

```typescript
// __tests__/helpers.ts
import { NextRequest } from "next/server";

export function createTestRequest(
  url: string,
  options?: {
    method?: string;
    body?: Record<string, unknown>;
    headers?: Record<string, string>;
    sandboxUserId?: string;
  },
): NextRequest {
  const { method = "GET", body, headers = {}, sandboxUserId } = options || {};
  const fullUrl = url.startsWith("http") ? url : `http://localhost:3000${url}`;
  const reqHeaders: Record<string, string> = { ...headers };

  if (sandboxUserId) {
    reqHeaders["x-sandbox-user-id"] = sandboxUserId;
  }

  const init: { method: string; headers: Record<string, string>; body?: string } = {
    method,
    headers: reqHeaders,
  };

  if (body) {
    init.body = JSON.stringify(body);
    reqHeaders["content-type"] = "application/json";
  }

  return new NextRequest(fullUrl, init);
}

export async function parseResponse(response: Response) {
  const json = await response.json();
  return { status: response.status, json };
}
```

### Writing Regression Tests

The key principle: **write tests for bugs that were found, not for code that works**.

```typescript
// __tests__/api/user/profile.test.ts
import { describe, it, expect } from "vitest";
import { createTestRequest, parseResponse } from "../../helpers";
import { GET, PATCH } from

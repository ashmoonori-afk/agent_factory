# Skill: ClickHouse Analytics Patterns

## When to Use
- Designing ClickHouse table schemas (MergeTree engine selection)
- Writing analytical queries (aggregations, window functions, joins)
- Optimizing query performance (partition pruning, projections, materialized views)
- Ingesting large volumes of data (batch inserts, Kafka integration)
- Migrating from PostgreSQL/MySQL to ClickHouse for analytics
- Implementing real-time dashboards or time-series analytics

## Overview

ClickHouse is a column-oriented database management system (DBMS) for online analytical processing (OLAP). It's optimized for fast analytical queries on large datasets.

**Key Features:**
- Column-oriented storage
- Data compression
- Parallel query execution
- Distributed queries
- Real-time analytics

## Table Design Patterns

### MergeTree Engine (Most Common)

```sql
CREATE TABLE markets_analytics (
    date Date,
    market_id String,
    market_name String,
    volume UInt64,
    trades UInt32,
    unique_traders UInt32,
    avg_trade_size Float64,
    created_at DateTime
) ENGINE = MergeTree()
PARTITION BY toYYYYMM(date)
ORDER BY (date, market_id)
SETTINGS index_granularity = 8192;
```

### ReplacingMergeTree (Deduplication)

```sql
-- For data that may have duplicates (e.g., from multiple sources)
CREATE TABLE user_events (
    event_id String,
    user_id String,
    event_type String,
    timestamp DateTime,
    properties String
) ENGINE = ReplacingMergeTree()
PARTITION BY toYYYYMM(timestamp)
ORDER BY (user_id, event_id, timestamp)
PRIMARY KEY (user_id, event_id);
```

### AggregatingMergeTree (Pre-aggregation)

```sql
-- For maintaining aggregated metrics
CREATE TABLE market_stats_hourly (
    hour DateTime,
    market_id String,
    total_volume AggregateFunction(sum, UInt64),
    total_trades AggregateFunction(count, UInt32),
    unique_users AggregateFunction(uniq, String)
) ENGINE = AggregatingMergeTree()
PARTITION BY toYYYYMM(hour)
ORDER BY (hour, market_id);

-- Query aggregated data
SELECT
    hour,
    market_id,
    sumMerge(total_volume) AS volume,
    countMerge(total_trades) AS trades,
    uniqMerge(unique_users) AS users
FROM market_stats_hourly
WHERE hour >= toStartOfHour(now() - INTERVAL 24 HOUR)
GROUP BY hour, market_id
ORDER BY hour DESC;
```

## Query Optimization Patterns

### Efficient Filtering

```sql
-- ✅ GOOD: Use indexed columns first
SELECT *
FROM markets_analytics
WHERE date >= '2025-01-01'
  AND market_id = 'market-123'
  AND volume > 1000
ORDER BY date DESC
LIMIT 100;

-- ❌ BAD: Filter on non-indexed columns first
SELECT *
FROM markets_analytics
WHERE volume > 1000
  AND market_name LIKE '%election%'
  AND date >= '2025-01-01';
```

### Aggregations

```sql
-- ✅ GOOD: Use ClickHouse-specific aggregation functions
SELECT
    toStartOfDay(created_at) AS day,
    market_id,
    sum(volume) AS total_volume,
    count() AS total_trades,
    uniq(trader_id) AS unique_traders,
    avg(trade_size) AS avg_size
FROM trades
WHERE created_at >= today() - INTERVAL 7 DAY
GROUP BY day, market_id
ORDER BY day DESC, total_volume DESC;

-- ✅ Use quantile for percentiles (more efficient than percentile)
SELECT
    quantile(0.50)(trade_size) AS median,
    quantile(0.95)(trade_size) AS p95,
    quantile(0.99)(trade_size) AS p99
FROM trades
WHERE created_at >= now() - INTERVAL 1 HOUR;
```

### Window Functions

```sql
-- Calculate running totals
SELECT
    date,
    market_id,
    volume,
    sum(volume) OVER (
